## Switching Between Views

Use the toggle buttons at the top of the mailbox:
- **Webmail (ðŸ“§):** For reading individual emails
- **Pivot (ðŸ“Š):** For sender-based analysis

Both views share the same data and sync status, so you can switch freely based on your current task.

## Design Philosophy

**Webmail View** = Traditional email client experience optimized for reading  
**Pivot View** = Data analysis tool optimized for pattern recognition and bulk actions

The separation ensures each workflow has the right UI/UX without compromising the other.
